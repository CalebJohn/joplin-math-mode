Interest is amortized yearly.

Compound interest is defined as
$$
\text{Interest} = P(1 + I)^N
$$
where
$P$ is the principal
$I$ is the annual interest rate
$N$ is the number of periods

Regular interest is defined as
$$
\text{Interest} = P(1 + I \times N)
$$

Notice how compounding interest uses a power term where regular interest is a multiple.

```math
hide: result
Principal = 500
Interest = 0.05
Years = 5
```

Regular Interest
= Regular = Principal * (1 + Interest * Years)

Compared against compound interest
= Compound = Principal * (1 + Interest)^Years

Netting an additional
= Compound - Regular
